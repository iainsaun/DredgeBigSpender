# Big Spender
An attempt to make money more useful, because I had way too much at the end of the game.

### Features
- Higher starting debt.
- Upgrades feel more expensive.
- Net enabled from the start (otherwise starting debt prevents you getting Nets).
- Regular fish will be worth much less, although there will be a small bump for trophies.
- Aberrations will be worth much more than regular fish for balance, and again with a bump for trophies.
- Purchaseable upgrades to improve aberration and trophy chances.
- Fuel? Food? Mooring Fee for towns?
- Panic increases aberrations chance by a lot, risk/reward in fishing.
- 'Wait' option while at sea, prevents attacks but freezes panic at current level.
- Buoys slowly reduce panic?

### Complete
- Fish sell cost reduced.
  - Night fish sell for a bit morethan day fish.
  - Aberrations sell for a lot more than regular fish.

### To Do

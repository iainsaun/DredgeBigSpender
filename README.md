# Big Spender
An attempt to make money more useful, because I had way too much at the end of the game.

### Features
- Higher starting debt.
- Upgrades cost a lot more.
- Net enabled from the start (otherwise starting debt prevents you getting Nets).
- Regular fish will be worth much less, although there will be a small bump for trophies.
- Aberrations will be worth slightly more for balance, and again with a bump for trophies.
- Purchaseable upgrades to improve aberration and trophy chances.
- Fuel and food cost?
- Panic increases aberrations chance by a lot, risk/reward in fishing.
- 'Wait' option while at sea, prevents attacks but freezes panic at current level.

### Complete
- Nothing is done yet.

### ToDo
- Everything, nothing is done.

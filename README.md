# Big Spender
An attempt to make money more useful, because I had way too much at the end of the game.

### Planned Features
- Higher starting debt.
- Upgrades feel more expensive.
- Net enabled from the start (otherwise starting debt prevents you getting Nets).
- Regular fish will be worth much less, although there will be a small bump for trophies.
- Aberrations will be worth much more than regular fish for balance, and again with a bump for trophies.
- Purchaseable upgrades to improve aberration and trophy chances.
- Fuel? Food? Mooring fee for towns?
- Panic increases aberrations chance by a lot, risk/reward in fishing.
- 'Wait' option while at sea, prevents attacks but freezes panic at current level, time will still pass so fish freshness will reduce.
- Buoys slowly reduce panic?
- QOL adjustments such as faster docking.

### Complete
- Fish sell cost reduced.
  - Night fish sell for more than day fish.
  - Aberrations sell for more than regular fish.
  - Trophies get a bump in sell price, maybe throw back the duds and keep these!
- Materials and general item values improved.
  - Dredged materials increased value, now worth dredging to sell.
  - Treasure is still treasure and very much worth selling, especially early game.
  - Ironhaven crates and canisters are now sellable and worth selling.
  - Shipwright at Greater Marrow is finally interested in buying materials.
- Faster docking thanks to copied FastDock mod.

### To Do
- Adjust starting debt.
- Enable Net from start.
- Upgrade option/tool for aberration/trophy chance.
- Positive relationship between panic and aberration chance.
- Fuel.
- Food.
  - Eat the fish?!
- Mooring fees.
- Calming buoys.
- 'Wait' at sea.
